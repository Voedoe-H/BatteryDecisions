# Battery RUL Prediction with Decision Trees

This repository explores data-driven approaches for predicting **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of batteries using the [Battery Life Cycle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ignaciovinuales/battery-remaining-useful-life-rul/data) from Kaggle. It focuses on interpretable models such as **Decision Trees** and includes preprocessing, feature selection, training, and evaluation pipelines.
